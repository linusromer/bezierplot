DESCRIPTION:
bezierplot is a Lua program as well as a (Lua)LaTeX package. 
Given a smooth function, bezierplot returns a smooth bezier path written
in TikZ notation (which also matches METAPOST) that approximates the 
graph of the function. For polynomial functions of degree <= 3 and 
inverses of them, the approximation is exact. bezierplot finds special 
points such as extreme points and inflection points and reduces the 
number of used points.
